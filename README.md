# Pedestrian-Detection
This pedestrian detection project utilizes OpenCV to detect and track pedestrians in a video stream. It employs a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for pedestrian detection, dynamically adjusting parameters based on estimated pedestrian dimensions. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected pedestrians, and their count is displayed on each frame.
